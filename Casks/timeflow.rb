  # Soft launch: TimeFlow is signed with a stable self-signed identity rather
  # than a notarized Developer ID one, so downloads still carry the macOS
  # quarantine flag and Gatekeeper blocks first launch. Strip it after install
  # so `brew install` gives a clean, no-prompt open. This postflight is removed
  # once the app ships notarized through Apple Developer.

  # uninstalls never race a running instance.

  # `brew uninstall --zap ercansavas/tap/timeflow` removes EVERYTHING the app
