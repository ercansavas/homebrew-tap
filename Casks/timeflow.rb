  # Soft launch: TimeFlow is ad-hoc signed (not yet notarized), so downloads
  # carry the macOS quarantine flag and Gatekeeper blocks first launch. Strip
  # it after install so `brew install` gives a clean, no-prompt open. This
  # postflight is removed once the app ships notarized through Apple Developer.

  # Quit the menubar app (which stops its child processes: bundled node backend,

  # uninstalls never race a running instance.

  # `brew uninstall --zap ercansavas/tap/timeflow` removes EVERYTHING the app
  # writes — no hand-rolled `rm -rf`. Covers runtime data, UserDefaults, the
  # WKWebView dashboard storage, and system caches.
